TITLE: I DON’T THINK IT’S GOING TO GET BETTER<br>
<br>
It felt right when I found this group. Everyone just seems to want to pretend that if you just try hard and believe then you’ll get the girl, fall in love, find the right job, but I knew that wasn’t true. And then I found this group and for once just one fucking time I was actually meeting people who saw the world the same way I did. But I guess now I’m just wondering what’s next? So we know we’re fucked - we’re at the bottom of the barrel, what now? Are we just supposed to spend the rest of our lives looking at these fucking normal idiots who can’t even see the real world around them? My friends are all brainwashed or blind, I can’t even talk to them about this stuff or they just give me the same bullshit platitudes as everyone else. I’m glad I have you guys, I’m just not sure what happens next.

Hey if your friends can’t see it then you don’t need them anyway. They’d probably leave you anyway if you keep looking behind the world’s curtain - most people aren’t ready for that.<br>
<br>
We’ve been sold lies by the media, our parents, our friends, EVERYBODY. FUCK THIS WORLD, spread the truth.<br>
<br>
I had a hard time accepting it too it’s fucking brutal but that’s how you know it’s the truth<br>
<br>
I feel bad too. Just once I want to know what it’s like for a girl to fucking want me but my fucking body has me cursed to be an ugly sack of shit so all I get is loneliness.<br>
<br>
Your mistake is giving a shit. Everyone else is just out to fuck each other over for money or sex, you can’t win with these shallow sluts if you’re looking for some bullshit meaning.<br></p>

FDA approves human testing of new procedure that could push lifespans past 130, says spokesperson<br>
<br>
“For centuries, we treated death and disease as separate. One to be accepted, the other to be treated. Today, we are thrilled by the FDA’s ruling, which will allow us to treat death as any other disease,” says Kessler, speaking on behalf of Genimax. Investors are excited as well, with analysts projecting that the death-delaying market will be worth over $2.5 trillion by....<br>

<br>
Wow, can’t wait to get to be a virgin in my 30s again. <br>
<br>
Lol imagine paying money to live longer<br>
<br>
Even with an extra 50 years my indecisive ass will still be trying to decide between a noose or gun<br></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p class="JUNE">[laughs] Wow these are wild.<br></p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="MAC">I dunno.<br>
I always wonder if they mean it.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE">I think it’s just dark humour.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">Sure, but what’s the punchline?<br>
“Ha ha, can’t wait to die alone?”<br>
I don’t mean they shouldn’t make those jokes. If it helps then it helps.<br>
Just wish people didn’t have to.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">And maybe sometimes we go to far, come out the other side of coping and start to believe things.<br>
Even when they aren’t true.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">It’s like.<br>
We’re all so remarkably good at making ourselves miserable. <br>
We see things we don’t have - things we don’t even want - but there’s a doubt. We’re expected to want them, so we start to wonder if we really do.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">It gets into our heads, we try to get things because we think we should, but we never stop to ask if we really want them, or at least if having them will make any difference.<br>
And then someone comes along with a trick to get us that one thing we think we need.<br>
And you buy into it, because you want to believe that if you have that one key thing, then that’s all you need.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">Usually doesn’t work.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE">Hmm, then people will get upset and frustrated, but to them, the answer’s obvious. <br>
They still want that one simple that will make them happy, and if they can’t have it, there has to be someone to blame.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">Like women.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE">[laughs] Yes, exactly. It’s like that Simpsons’ scene when Skinner<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">When Skinner goes to the 4H club!<br>
Yeah - like, “is it my repugnant personality that pushes people away? No, no it must be women being shallow bitches.” <br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">Wow how old was that episode?<br></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE">Huh, honestly couldn’t say, I still haven’t seen anything past season 47. <br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">Eh, you haven’t really missed much.<br>
Kind of got weird once they started replacing the actors with voice generators.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE">I heard about that! That’s mostly what’s kept me from getting back into it. I go online and try to figure out where I’m supposed to start but it’s like everyone has their own opinion about the best order, when it started to go downhill, which episodes I should watch.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE">I just get frustrated and give up before I can even figure it out because I can’t bring myself to go through a forty page argument about which seasons are the “good” seasons.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">It’s remarkable, huh? A million ways to connect with people, and somehow it’s mostly complaints and arguments that seem to attract the most attention.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE">[laughs] Don’t pretend you don’t love arguing over the most petty crap.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">Sure, sure, but it can get vicious, and it’s not any better when we talk about something serious.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">You end up with all these miserable people being miserable together.<br>
I mean, you saw those comments.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">They can’t build each other up, they only reinforce their views - it’s like looking into a different world. <br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">I get it, it’s patronising to hear people telling you it gets better.<br>
But shouldn’t the opposite be just as bad?<br>
What’s the point in just saying “things will never be any better because everything is shit”?<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">And then<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">God<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">And then you have a couple thousand people all saying that same defeatist crap to each other.<br></p>

<p class="JUNE">Because that is the world to them. <br>
Maybe they haven’t tried everything, but they’ve tried a lot, and they only seem to end up in the same place. <br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">Sure, but pretty soon [snaps] they believe their world is THE world. They build up this shared story about how things are and they only ever listen to each other. <br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">I used to really believe that facts were facts.<br>
Like, no matter what you personally believe the world is still the world.<br>
It should still be there, unchanged.<br>
But<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
I don’t know if that’s true.<br>
I think what people believe matters a lot more than I thought it did - at least for them. <br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">The world is the world, but our perceptions are the only thing we have, so once those start changing things diverge. You have people whose worlds don’t even intersect, just running parallel.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">Incredibly close<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">Impossibly distant<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">We’ve seen it happen again and again - that’s what Emil really wants to avoid.<br></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE">Do you think he can?<br></p>
<br>
<p class="MAC">.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
Maybe? I mean, at least we’re making the attempt.<br>
It’s better than just being another cesspool.<br></p>
