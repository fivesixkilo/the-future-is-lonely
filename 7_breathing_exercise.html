  <p class="MAC">Good MOOORRRNING</p>

  <p class="JUNE">Ugh, what’re you doing dragging genuine enthusiasm in here? </p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Aw come on, we can’t all be a bunch of dour hipsters. Besides, I know you missed me.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I dunno, was sort of hoping you wouldn’t come back from vacation, was already thinking about cannibalising your side of the office. You know, maybe a reading nook over there, little gym in that corner.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">But if you didn’t have me who’d bring decent coffee in the morning?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I’ve already got some.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Cafeteria swill? Give me that.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Hey I was drinking</p>

  <p class="JUNE centered1"><mark>that.</mark></p>
  </div>
</div>
  <p class="MAC">No you were enduring it. </p>
  
  <p class="MAC">This is why you need me around, gotta maintain some standards. Here, grabbed you a cappuccino from El Campo, thought you might like to know what real coffee tastes like.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">[laughs] You’re a snob, you know that right? <br>
  Should I be drinking this with my pinky out?</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">That’s for tea, and someone has to be, how else would you know you’re liking the wrong things? </p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Now come on, what’d I miss? Did the engineers manage to bring down the servers again? Any fun bugs?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">No no nononono, we’re not going right into shop talk. You’ve been ghosting me all week, I need to bask in stories about your vacation. </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Still can’t believe you wouldn’t tell me where you were going.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Well, I didn’t really tell anyone where I was going. Vacation’s a lot better when you don’t have to worry about your boss trying to reach you after hours. Some of us like to have some time away from the office. </p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Speaking of which, surprised you didn’t decide to move a bed in here.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Yeah ok Mr. Secret Agent, now dish, where’d you go to escape these days of eternal dreary rain? If there isn’t at least one tropical drink involved I’m going to be very disappointed in you.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Well prepare to be disappointed because I went north, sort of took a lazy road trip around Banff. </p>
  
  <p class="MAC">You would not believe how beautiful it is this time of year.</p>

  <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Banff?</mark> </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>You mean Canada?</mark> </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Like, below freezing, couple feet of snow, grizzlies, that Banff?</mark><br>
  <mark>May I ask why?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>What are you complaining about, I thought you liked snow?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Yeah I like seeing snow, I like knowing it’s there, that doesn’t mean I’m going to spend my vacation like some crazy mountain man.</mark> </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>I like being somewhere I can wear a swimsuit and get sick on fruity drinks with shitty paper umbrellas and watch a bunch of unhappy families put up with each other, all the while counting the days until the trip is over and they can go back to loathing each other in silence.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>[laughs] Repressed childhood trauma?</mark> </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Mmm</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>But that is exactly why I went to Banff. If I wanted to be surrounded by people I would have just stayed at work.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Sometimes it just feels good to get out of… everything really. Every time I go it’s like one of those great full-body stretches.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>You know?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>I just feel so bunched up and cramped when I stay in town too long. Need to be somewhere you can’t even see the next town.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Mhm. Did you even plan anything or just freeze your ass off for a week?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>[laughs] Oh I bet you’re a joy on vacation.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>What?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Plans? Seriously?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>You can do whatever you feel like, don’t need to go out there with a full itinerary.</mark> </p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Go for a hike, climb a mountain, slap a salmon out of a river like a goddamn bear. Throw rocks at those drones that sound like a flock of hornets. You’ve got 2500 square miles to just be.</mark> </p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Sometimes it’s nice to get away from things like “should” and “plans".</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Ok well aside from slapping at fish in a river, what’d you do?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Hiked, camped, just kinda wandered around, whatever direction looked good. Which, to be fair, was every direction, just beautiful country up there.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Mhm, you bring back any pictures?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Oh yeah, actually used up a couple rolls of film this time, left my stupid shutter-release somewhere though.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>What?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Oh nothing, just didn’t realise I was talking to my great-grandfather.</mark><br>
  <mark>I can’t decide if you’re a time traveler or just a hipster.</mark><br>
  <mark>Like, did they pull you out of a cryo pod? Were you stunned by the wonders of the world today? Do you have a strange fascination for hard candies?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Oh I see how it is, guess you don’t want to see any of the pictures then.</mark></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="JUNE">Hah, no, I mean it in the best possible way. I’m glad you live at a different speed from everybody else.<br>
  But really, a film camera? I think you’re just afraid of being called a hipster because you know it’s true.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Well you got me there, but it’s not really about the pictures, hell I don’t even get them developed half the time. </p>
  
  <p class="MAC">I do it for the process. </p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Everyone says this, but it really makes you slow down and focus on the moment. It’s more about… just seeing the world for what it is. You’re there, just wholly encompassed by the scene around you, seeing every angle of rock, how the trees tilt in the wind. </p>
  
  <p class="MAC">At first, I feel laser focused - I’m peering through the viewfinder, just finding that one point of inspiration, but after I look long enough it’s like my brain zooms out. I start to see the forest and the trees. Then I can feel the ground through my boots, and the mountain underneath that’s getting raised up a millimetre a millennia. </p>
  
  <p class="MAC">I just</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">I just feel the whole place I’m in, but at the same time it’s only a place because I’m there to experience it.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Wow</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Yeah you know if you want some recommendations for places to visit I could </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">No I mean, wow, what did you smoke before coming in today?</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">[laughs] Oh fuck off</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">No, no I don’t judge, in fact I want to try whatever it is, because that’s some serious “one with the cosmos” shit.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Ok ok laugh it up, at least my hobbies are more interesting than exploring a new bar every weekend and treating the bartenders like therapists.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">.<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  That’s entirely accurate.<br>
  But I still resent it.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">At least I get out and meet people instead of acting like a hermit.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Solitude’s underrated. Seriously, when was the last time you were even really alone?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Mac<br>
  My last boyfriend was in college, and he dumped me to go work in a fishery in Nova Scotia.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Wait really?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Really.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Imagine<br>
  If you will<br>
  Being 19 and finding out your high school sweetheart would rather gut fish for a living than stay with you.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">I feel like<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  This explains a lot about you.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Yeah, now you know why I can’t stand seafood.<br>
  Repressed trauma has a weird aftertaste.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Hah, that’s fun.<br>
  But uh, not really the kind of “alone” that I was thinking about.<br>
  I mean choosing to be alone, just with yourself.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">No thanks, I’m terrified of introspection.<br>
  If you stare into the void the void stares back, moves in, you and the void get a house in the suburbs and resent each other until the sweet release of death.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">I know that feeling. </p>
  
  <p class="MAC">I used to really need people around me or I just felt on edge, like I was untethered and the world would leave me behind if I didn’t cling to something. </p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Everything just felt disconnected, like everyone else was sharing this natural bond that I was somehow excluded from. </p>
  
  <p class="MAC">I still feel like that sometimes<br>
  But that’s life, just have to have ways of getting through it.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">And mine just happen to be alcohol and depressing poetry.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">No shame in that, I certainly have those days. But how about we try something?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">.<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  Fine, queue’s slow today anyway.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Alright turn around - hands off the keyboard. </p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Just close your eyes and wait for a bit.</p>
  
  I swear to god if you try and scare me.
  
  <p class="MAC">Come on, just relax.</p>
  
  
  
  <p class="MAC">Listen to your breathing.</p>
