<p class="AMALIA2"><mark class="AMALIAMARK">Welcome back to the show. What happens when we’re suddenly not needed anymore? On paper, it sounds freeing, but life isn’t always quite so tidy. Before the break we spoke with renowned psychiatrist Dr. Miki Coates about alienation stemming from an increasingly automated work force. In this upcoming segment, we’re going to be talking about social media. MatchPoint, Meet Cute, Spark. Every day there is a new, fast-lane approach to meeting people and making connections, but Rose is a company that claims to have a different approach. For listeners who aren’t familiar with Rose, it is a growing social media site with a curious goal: creating happiness. I reached out to a woman who works at Rose to get her perspective on the uneasy landscape of social media.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE">I didn’t believe it myself when it was explained to me.</p>

<p class="AMALIA2"><mark class="AMALIAMARK">That’s Ana - she spoke confidentially so her name and voice have been changed - she’s been with Rose for around a year now and is deeply involved with Rose’s happiness algorithm. I met with her over coffee.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE">Happiness. You know, you can’t make people happy, but Emil insisted. <br>
He said that at least trying was better than nothing.</p>

<p class="AMALIA2"><mark class="AMALIAMARK">She’s talking about Emil Stewart, Lead Creative Architect of Rose and the idea man behind the happiness algorithm. Emil has made the rounds, serving in various management roles throughout Silicon Valley. He was also the central figure during Rose’s most recent controversy - the near-death a of young man who had been unknowingly shadow-banned as part of the platform’s efforts to stamp out negativity, check out episode five-sixty-four of our show to hear more about that. I asked Ana for her take.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA"><mark>What was the internal reaction when you saw the news story?</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Shellshock.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>You know, the kind of work we do creates a sort of distance between us and the users sometimes.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Three hundred-million people, sometimes it just feels like a number.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>That moment, with Michael, it changed some things for a lot of us.</mark><br>
<mark>It changed a lot of things for some of us.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>We didn’t have the liberty not to think about our actions anymore.</mark><br>
<mark>I mean, he was the kind of person that Rose is supposed to help, and to have let him down in such a careless way made me question if we should even keep trying.</mark><br>
<mark>I thought about resigning.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA"><mark>But you stayed on.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>I did, I did.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA"><mark>Was any official action taken?</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Yeah, I was surprised.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>I mean not surprised, but it’s easy to get jaded.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>To just expect people to get written off because, in the big picture, what is one or two people that have a bad time.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA2"><mark class="AMALIAMARK">Detractors claim that Rose’s reliance on machine learning for decision-making is dangerous, that these sorts of things should be put in human hands. For some, the thought of turning over more of their lives to synthetic hands is barely an afterthought, but many question if it’s wise to give up so much control.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>It’s dangerous</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>But I don’t know if it’s uniquely dangerous.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>We’ve already started hurting people with predictive algorithms. We have ones that generate your interest rates on loans before you’ve even walked in the door. Sentencing programs that oh so surprisingly seem to hand out sentences on the familiar skin colour gradient. We’re being targeted, identified as dissidents, potential criminals, poor employees - why can’t we do something good?</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>If we can make people lonely, then surely we can find people who are lonely and reel them back in.</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>That’s the goal anyway.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA"><mark>Is that possible?</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Emil certainly thinks so.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA"><mark>And is he right?</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>Maybe.</mark><br>
<mark>Maybe not right now</mark><br>
<mark>But maybe.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA2"><mark class="AMALIAMARK">That’s one of the tricky things about happiness - it’s an elusive creature, and its inverse is parasitic.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>It seems like a lot of people get comfortable in their loneliness. You know, they settle into it, kind of resigned to feeling that way and don’t look too hard at giving it up.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA"><mark>But some people want to be alone.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Alone</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Not lonely</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Nobody wants that but it happens just the same.</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>We have more and more demands on our time, while simultaneously facing more separation and abstraction. When was the last time you saw a cashier at a grocery store? How many banks still have human tellers? And when it comes to work, you might be working with a diverse team across the globe, but you probably won’t meet a single one of your coworkers in person.</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>We don’t have the time or knowledge to deal with it ourselves, so we internalise it.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA2"><mark class="AMALIAMARK">I think about Ana’s point later as I package up these audio files to be sent to our editor in Montreal.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>You’re not a person who feels lonely, loneliness just becomes a part of existing. You know, like making a shopping list:</mark> </p>

<div class="dialogue">
<p class="JUNE"><mark>It becomes the story we tell ourselves.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA2"><mark class="AMALIAMARK">And that’s the heart of the issue: how can you solve a problem that’s so personalised, so internalised, all through rearranging posts on a person’s social media feed? Because of course, we’ve all felt lonely, but for many that feeling is becoming the default. We’re accustomed to it, so much so that sometimes we can’t even recognise that it’s there. I asked Ana if she ever felt lonely.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>[laughs] Since I was a kid. Shit, I remember - must have been</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>fourth grade - I was new. New school, new neighborhood.</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>It didn’t smell right, I just knew that part of town didn’t smell like home and I hated it. I used to take a shower the second I got home every day just so that wrong smell wouldn’t start leeching in to me.</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>The worst part about being new was that everyone could tell.</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>We went on this stupid field trip to a train museum out in the middle of nowhere.</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>The kid next to me was silent, he’d just glance sideways every now and then and then crane his neck to where his friends were at the front of the bus.</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Like, you could tell he’d really pulled the short straw sitting next to me.</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>But I guess the boredom got to him, because he finally said something.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>He told me he liked my shirt - it was just this ratty goldenrod t-shirt that I hated wearing.</mark><br>
<mark>I hated it because it had a stain on the hem and I always felt embarrassed like everyone would just instantly see that. But he just told me he liked my shirt, and then he pointed at his and I hadn’t noticed it before but somehow he was wearing the exact same colour shirt. “Yellow’s my favourite colour.”</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Do you remember that?</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>The safety and simplicity of making connections.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>It’s a shame we grow out of that.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>I guess that’s a part of what Rose wants to give back.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Partly, we just have a better idea of what we want. You know, we’ve all been burnt enough to at least be a little choosey.</mark> </p>

<p class="AMALIA2"><mark class="AMALIAMARK">Ana isn’t alone. Feelings of loneliness are on the rise. A new study, published by the Department of Health, found thirty-five percent of people under thirty reported having no friends.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>It’s a Catch-22: we want to connect, but no one wants to connect to someone who’s alone.</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>It’s primal, there’s that voice in the back of our heads that says, “there’s a reason they’re alone. Better not get too close.”</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>So even if you are alone, or feeling that way, you have to hide it.</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>You have to.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>We all do it in different ways. I’ve kind of always kept myself on the outside.</mark> </p>

<p class="AMALIA"><mark>Now when you say the outside, what do you mean?</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Oh just</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>You know</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mar><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>The periphery.</mark> </p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Like I’m lingering outside a restaurant, just peeking in, trying to decide to go home or go inside, hoping that someone inside will wave you in, but no one seems to have the guts.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>I think I used to take pride in it. You know, I might be on my own, but at least I’m better than <i>those</i> people with their vapid parties and curated friend-groups.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>It’s easier - sometimes anyway - to devalue what you want than to achieve it.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA"><mark>So as someone that, from my perspective, it would appear Rose is looking to help, do you think it can? Do you think you’ll be able to make it work?</mark></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<p class="JUNE"><mark>I want it to. I don’t want to create more of the same. I don’t want our goals to be overrun by corporate reality. We need to prove that you can do more than make a better monetisation engine. It’s scary, taking that first step towards connecting with someone else, hopefully we can give some people a nudge.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>It’s about proving that it’s possible.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA"><mark>Who do you need to prove it to?</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Everyone.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>Ourselves.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA2"><mark class="AMALIAMARK">We said our goodbyes, and Ana walked out of the cafe throwing me a curt wave as the door shut behind her, presumably heading back to work. I stayed at the table, staring at my phone. The notification centre informed me that I had forty-seven unread messages - three had come in during my conversation with Ana. I pushed in my chair, paid for the coffee, and told myself I’d reply to those later.</mark></p>

<p class="AMALIA2"><mark class="AMALIAMARK">Coming up next, we talk with a viral pathologist who thinks we need to start studying loneliness the same way we study the flu.</mark></p>
