USER: Janet Nicholson<br>
ISSUE: hello sorry to bother you but it seems like i can’t send messages at the moment is it maybe an error?</p>

<p class="JUNE">Hi Janet, I see you’re having some trouble sending messages, could you tell me a bit more about your problem?</p>

<p class="JANET">.<br>

hi<br>
hello<br>
.<br>
.<br>

sorry I’m a little slow</p>

<p class="JUNE">Don’t worry, take your time, I’ll be here.</p>

.<br>
.<br>
ok<br>
it’s my grandson<br>
.<br>
usually he talks to me a few times a week<br>
.<br>
.<br>
but i haven’t heard from him in quite a while<br>
and he hasn’t responded to my messages<br>
i think there may be something wrong with my account</p>

<p class="JUNE">Alright, well let me take a look on the back-end here and I’ll see if we can’t get that sorted out.</p>

<p class="JUNE centered2">Quarantined? That’s new</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<p class="JUNE">Hey Mac?<br>
I’m looking at someone’s profile here.</p>

<p class="JUNE">Under “privileges” everything is just listed as quarantined.<br>
Do you know what that’s about?</p>

<p class="MAC">Ooooh yeah, yeah<br>
I think that’s new, Emil’s team just enabled that last night.</p>

<p class="JUNE">[laughs] Well that’s fun, it’d be nice to wake up one day and not have to deal with new features nobody told us about.</p>

<p class="MAC">Right? You should have been here during the early days. <br>
Originally, inactive accounts were pruned pretty often - you hadn’t posted anything or sent a message in a couple months and poof, you’d be deactivated. </p>

<p class="MAC">Problem was, all the moderator accounts we use are basically just skeletons we strap the moderation suite onto, it’s not like we actually use them on the site.</p>

<p class="JUNE">Oh [laughs] I think I can see where this is going, they deactivated the moderators, right?</p>

<p class="MAC">Bingo.<br>
We all come in to work one day and no one can log in. We were in full blown panic mode until one of the engineers checked the inactive account list. </p>

<p class="MAC">Luckily, I doubt any users actually noticed, but I think we’ve come pretty close to disaster a few times now.</p>

<p class="JUNE">Shit, yeah you’d think they’d learn by now, can’t imagine how many people would be pissed off if the site just went down.<br>
So anyway, quarantines, what’s that about?</p>

<p class="MAC">From what Emil said, it’s kind of like a soft ban.<br>
People can still access their account, but other people can’t see the things they’re posting.<br>
I guess it’s kind of like a time out, just super de-ranks them on the sorting algorithm so their stuff doesn’t show up,  blocks messages, things like that.</p>

<p class="JUNE">Do you think I can override that?</p>

<p class="MAC">Mm, probably not.<br>
It’s not really something that our tools can even do, it’s just up to the algorithm.<br>
I don’t think you’d want to though. It should only affect repeated and pretty severe violations.</p>

<p class="JUNE">O-kay good to know.<br>
Still wish they’d tell us before rolling out stuff like that.</p>

<p class="JUNE">Alright<br>
Let’s see what he did</p>

algorithm-flagged: violent language; negativity; anger; graphic content</p>

<p class="ROSE">anyone else ever just look at security questions and laugh?<br>
“where did you go on your honeymoon?”<br>
“where did you meet your first crush?”<br>
“what is your best friend’s name?”<br>
thanks, don’t need to be reminded that I can’t answer any of those</p>

<p class="ROSE">feels real good to talk to someone about depression and just hear “don’t be a pussy bro”</p>

<p class="ROSE">fucking tired of EVERYONE telling me it just fucking gets better<br>
it doesn’t</p>

<p class="ROSE">and all these fake friends who you try to talk to and don’t say a thing<br>
it’s like i don’t even exist</p>

<p class="ROSE">do you ever just think about the future and it instantly ruins your day? we all fucking die alone anyway so why does it matter if it takes an extra 60 years or if we just do it ourselves</p>

<p class="ROSE">let’s face it things aren’t going to get better for us. you can try to be a nice person. you can try to make friends. the more you learn about the world the worse it gets.</p>

<p class="ROSE">i just NEED to know that someone out there cares because it can’t be just me</p>

<p class="ROSE">i cant be me its too hard</p>

<p class="ROSE">i cant keep doing this over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over</p>

<p class="ROSE">i need EVERYTHING TO JUST FUCKING STOP</p>
