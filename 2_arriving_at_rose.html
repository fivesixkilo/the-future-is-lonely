  <p class="JOSH" style="padding-top:300px;"><mark>Hi, welcome to Rose, how can I help you?</mark></br></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Um hi</mark></p>
<p class="JUNE"><mark>I’m June Owens, I think I have a meeting</mark></p>
<p class="JUNE"><mark>Well, not a meeting, but I got a message from Emil...?</mark></p>
<br>
<p class="JOSH"><mark>Oh, June, yes Emil said you would be stopping by.</mark><br>
<mark>I’ll let him know you’ve arrived. He may be in a meeting, so please take a seat.</mark><br>
<mark>My name’s Josh, by the way, please let me know if you need anything while you wait.</mark></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE"><mark>I will, thanks.</mark></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE"><i><mark>He seemed friendly</mark></i></p>
<p class="JUNE"><i><mark>Well, not friendly, nice I guess</mark></i></p>
<p class="JUNE"><i><mark>I mean he has to be if he’s the receptionist</mark></i></p>
<p class="JUNE"><i><mark>But still. Nice.</mark></i></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE"><i><mark>Of course he’s probably just surprised that Emil would invite some random nobody to come to his office.</mark></i></p>
<p class="JUNE"><i><mark>“I think I have a meeting?” Did I really say that?</mark></i></p>
<p class="JUNE"><i><mark>Maybe he thought it was funny</mark></i></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE"><i><mark>Probably not</mark></i></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE"><i><mark>I wonder what he told Emil</mark></i></p>
<p class="JUNE"><i><mark>“Hey there’s this dishevelled weirdo out here who thinks she might have a meeting with you, should I call security?”</mark></i></p>
<p class="JUNE"><i><mark>I probably would if I were him</mark></i></p>
<br>
<p class="JOSH"><mark>June, would you like some water? Coffee?</mark></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE">Oh, yeah, yeah some water would be fantastic.</p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE"><i>He’s probably busy, I could have gotten it myself.</i></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE"><i>God how long is this meeting going to take?</i></p>

<br>
<p class="JOSH">Here you go, sorry about the wait, Emil said he’d get out as soon as he could.</p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE">It’s fine, I can wait.</p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE"><i>Was that a real smile?</i></p>
<p class="JUNE"><i>Just a polite smile?</i></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE"><i>It’s like a spa in here.</i></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE"><i>How can he work when it’s this quiet?</i></p>
<p class="JUNE"><i>I feel like I’d be holding my breath the entire time.</i></p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE"><i>I should have prepared more<br>
I haven’t even looked over half this stuff since submission<br>
How did Emil even find it?</i></p>
<br>
<p class="EMIL">June, June! So sorry to keep you waiting.<br>
I am thrilled you could make it in to meet with me.</p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE">No problem, it wasn’t long.
Mr. Stewart, right?</p>
<br>
<p class="EMIL">[laughs] Just Emil, please, that’s what everybody on the team calls me.</p>
<br>
<p class="JUNE">Oh, ok, it’s nice to meet you Emil.</p>
<br>
<p class="EMIL">You too, glad to finally meet you in person.<br>
Although I confess I have some advantage given that I’ve read so much of your work.<br>
Interested in a coffee? The cafe here does fantastic lattes.</p>

<p class="EMIL"><mark>Mm, damn that’s good.</mark> <br>
<mark>Right, so let’s talk, I didn’t invite you here just to have a drink.</mark> <br>
<mark>It’s good though, right?</mark><br></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Mhm, it’s great.</mark><br></p>

<p class="EMIL"><mark>June, are you familiar with what we do here at Rose?</mark><br></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Social media, that’s most of what I’ve heard.</mark><br>
<mark>I haven’t used your platform myself, but it always seems to be in the news.</mark><br></p>

<p class="EMIL"><mark>Yes it does, for better or for worse.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>“Social media” though, what a vague term, I think just about anything fits that description.</mark> <br>
<mark>You can’t even watch TV without the live feed from random commenters.</mark><br></p>

<p class="EMIL"><mark>But yes, we are in the social media business, but we’re doing our best to change it.</mark><br></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>What do you mean “change it”?</mark><br></p>

<p class="EMIL"><mark>Well, I can’t go in to too much detail without you signing a stack of NDAs.</mark><br>
<mark>Let us say, that I believe social media can be more - can do more.</mark> <br>
<mark>For people.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Ok, that’s</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>I’m not sure I understand</mark></p>

<p class="EMIL"><mark>Personally, what are your thoughts on social media?</mark><br>
<mark>Just in general.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Well, like I said, I don’t engage with it too much.</mark><br>
<mark>I think for some people it’s a powerful way to connect.</mark><br>
<mark>For a lot of people I think it’s</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark></p>

<p class="EMIL"><mark>Go ahead, be blunt.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Well</mark><br>
<mark>I think for a lot of people it’s an obsession.</mark><br>
<mark>Like, it doesn’t offer any extrinsic benefits, at least not the way they use it.</mark><br>
<mark>For them, engaging with social media is the whole point in and of itself, not sharing or connecting or anything else.</mark><br>
<mark>They put a lot of themselves into it, but I don’t think they get enough out.</mark><br>
<mark>It</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>God this sounds mean</mark><br>
<mark>It reminds me of people in casinos, pulling the slot machine lever over and over and over</mark><br>
<mark>Just for the chance that the next pull will make them feel what they want.</mark></p>

<p class="EMIL"><mark>No, no I understand completely.</mark><br>
<mark>I can tell we’re already in agreement, although I would simplify it and just say social media is failing.</mark><br>
<mark>Everyone has it - even if you don’t have an account you can be sure every platform is tracking you through every possible avenue.</mark> <br>
<br>
<mark>But what is the point?</mark> <br>
<br>
<mark>Obviously for the providers it is - largely - to make money. But what about the users?</mark> <br>
<br>
<mark>We know it doesn’t make us happier, that’s more or less an accepted fact. But that doesn’t stop us, we are practically compelled to utilise it because if we don’t our absence will be noted.</mark> <br>
<br>
<mark>If you don’t engage, it’s something of an oddity. It makes a statement - we consider the use of social media so normalised that avoiding it requires some kind of justification.</mark><br>
<br>
<mark>It’s all so visionless.</mark> <br>
<br>
<mark>Every company just seems to offer a laissez-faire environment where they leave the users to their own devices. Is it any wonder that it inevitably degrades into tribal warfare over the most petty things?</mark><br>
<br>
<mark>So again, what is the point? Why should users bother, why should it even exist? It may have its uses, but it also engenders anxiety and breeds malignancy.</mark><br>
<br>
<mark>That’s where we</mark><br>
<mark>Rose that is</mark><br>
<mark>are different.</mark><br>
<br>
<mark>We are pegging success on one and only one metric: happiness.</mark></p>

<p class="JUNE">[laughs]<br>
Sorry it’s just<br>
How would you even quantify that?</p>

<p class="EMIL">No, no I understand.<br>
It does sound impossible, almost paradoxical.<br>
<br>
We mean to deliver on the promise of social media as a way of sharing and connecting lives to make us happier, not just to inflate meaningless engagement metrics.<br>
<br>
We don’t know what we want out of relationships usually, but we know when we aren’t getting what we need. And so you have these lonely, desperate people going online, looking for some sort of solace, and instead they just get thrown into the turbulence of the world and subjected to one shitty interaction after another. I want to show people it does not have to be that way.<br>
<br>
I have to admit, I misled you somewhat when I first contacted you.<br>
Now<br>
I love your previous work<br>
but it’s not your previous work that I want to discuss.<br>
I want to discuss your future.<br>
<br>
What we are developing is the first step, the nascent embryo of what will one day be the invisible hand that guides us towards happiness. You don’t seem to think that’s possible.<br>
<br>
I want you to prove yourself wrong.</p>

<p class="JUNE">I think you might be overestimating me.</p>

<p class="EMIL">This is just the first step, but I want it to be the right first step.<br>
  <br>
So what do you say?</p>
