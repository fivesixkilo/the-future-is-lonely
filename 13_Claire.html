  <mark>June!</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Wha-</mark><br>
  <mark>Oh</mark><br>
  <mark>Claire, hey!</mark></p>
  
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>Hey yourself!</mark><br>
  <mark>Holy shit I haven’t seen you in ages.</mark><br>
  <mark>What’s up, how’s it going?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Hah, yeah I’ve been busy with work I guess.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>Uh-huh.</mark><br>
  <mark>Well I get that.</mark><br>
  <mark>Congrats by the way, heard you got a new job.</mark><br>
  <mark>Actually, are you headed anywhere right now?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Yeah I was</mark><br>
  <mark>Um</mark><br>
  <mark>going to buy a handle of vodka and some popcorn and cry my eyes out in bed listening to depressing podcasts</mark><br>
  <mark>Well no, not really</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>We-elll if I’m not distracting you from anything too serious, what do you say to a drink? I just got off work and could use one.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Yeah, yeah you know that sounds really good right now.</mark><br>
  <mark>No wine though, unless you want this evening to turn depressing real fast.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>[laughs] I’ll keep that in mind. Come on, what’s new, how’s work?</mark></p>
  </div>
  </div>
  
  
  
  <div style="background-image: url(images/claire/bar.jpg); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: center; background-size:cover; min-height:1281;">
    <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>[laughs] Shit I’ve missed you, why don’t we do this more often.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Oh you know, I’m super busy, keep a very tight schedule.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>Mhm, I bet.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>You know, gotta hustle, can’t take time away from the griiiiind.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>Pfft, didn’t say you’re working for Rose? That is the ultimate anti-hipster corporate bullshit.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>I know right? College-me would probably stand outside my apartment shouting about how I was buying in to the capitalist oppressors’ lifestyle. Which, to be fair, I kinda am. I remember thinking I would never work somewhere like that. It’s funny, it’s so hard to remember convictions when holding on means giving something else up.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>Yeah, but it sounds like you’re still doing good work even if it’s not what you expected. Do you like it?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>I don’t know.</mark><br>
  <mark>It’s not what I expected.</mark><br>
  <mark>Hah, I actually almost shouted at my sort of boss the other day.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>[laughs] Wow and you still have a job?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>I know, I know. I’m surprised too.</mark><br>
  <mark>You know, this is so much better than the night I had planned.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>Ah, so you did have plans, I thought you looked like you were heading somewhere.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Oh yeah.</mark><br>
  <mark>Hot date with the guy who works the night shift at the gas station on Broadway.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>Oh shit really? I didn’t know you were dating! Tell me about him!</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Well you know, lately I’ve just felt like we’re kind of stuck in a routine? Just feels like we’re playing out the same conversation over and over. He asks me if I need anything else, I shake my head “just the vodka”, he rings me up and I walk out.</mark> </p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>You’ve never actually spoken to this man outside of the gas station have you?</mark></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="JUNE">Nah, why ruin what we’ve already got, you know? You can’t break that sacred cashier-customer relationship, I’d have to find a new place to buy liquor at three in the morning.</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Ah no! You really had me going there. You were seeing someone though, right? Something with a double-u, Wesley, Warren?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Wes. <br>
  “Seeing” would be a generous term. <br>
  Last time he stayed over he said he had to get up early, right? He gets out of bed at like, five AM. I groan some kind of goodbye but he’s already out the door. </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I wake up a couple hours later, start making coffee and my fucking blender is missing! <br>
  Dude Netflix-and-chilled me out of a blender.</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">[laughs] Oh my god - oh my god really?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">And the worst part<br>
  The worst part is he only took the base</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Seriously?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">the bit with the motor. So now we’ve both got half this useless stupid blender - oh god is this what divorce feels like?<br>
  I guess he couldn’t find the top cause it was still in the dishwasher so he just ran off with the base and now I’ve just got the fucking top sitting around my kitchen as a constant reminder of my latest failed attempt at socialising.</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Yeah that’s pretty bad<br>
  I<br>
  Wow</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Hah, come on don’t feel too bad for me, he was a probably one of the better guys I’ve met, all things considered.<br>
  ‘Sides, I shared, now it’s your turn.</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Oh. Well, you know nothing exciting like that. Still engaged, I guess more than engaged now that we’ve got the wedding date set, it’s actually really </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Wai<br>
  Wha<br>
  YOU’RE ENGAGED?</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">[laughs]<br>
  Uh, yeah, I guess for a couple months now.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Oh wow - congratulations! That’s fantastic.<br>
  Why didn’t I know about this? I definitely should have known about this.</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Um.<br>
  I did try to tell you, I guess you just didn’t see the messages.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Shiiiiiit. <br>
  Shit I am an asshole.<br>
  I totally should have known.</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Hey, hey come on.<br>
  You know now.<br>
  I know you’ve been busy, sometimes life just gets out ahead of us.<br>
  I tried getting in touch a few times, I figured you just needed space.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Ah, Claire come here. There is no way my fucking antisocial bullshit is getting in the way of celebrating.<br>
  God no wonder you look so fucking gorgeous right now, got that ethereal glow of love. <br>
  When’d it happen, I need the details.</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Well, it wasn’t this big grand thing - Vihaan didn’t get down on a knee in front of the Eiffel tower or any crap like that, I would have hated that.</p>
   
  <p class="CLAIRE">We had this camping trip planned for weeks, and looking back he was weirdly excited, you know? We both love camping, but I should have known he was a little too enthusiastic.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">[laughs] Aw that’s sweet.</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">The third day, he got up early to make coffee, brought it back inside the tent. We were just sitting in the sleeping bag trying not to burn our hands on those little tin mugs. I can still picture it so clearly - the sun was just breaking over the San Juans, peaks lit up like wildfire. <br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  It was perfect.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">[laughs]</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">And then - and then Vihaan spills coffee all over himself cause he’s rooting through his backpack and he finally pulls out a ring but he’s also rolling around and cursing while the sleeping bag’s filling up with coffee and I’m SCREAMING because my butt’s getting soaked and don’t even notice at first because I’m laughing too hard.<br>
  .<br>
  It was more than I ever thought it could be.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Oh my god that’s so beautiful.<br>
  Shit<br>
  Now you’re gonna make me cry.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I can’t believe I didn’t hear about this sooner.</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Well now’s your chance to make it up to me - we’re doing invitations this week and if I don’t see your reply I will personally drag your sorry ass there and make you the fucking flower girl.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">[laughs] Alright alright I’ll do anything but that.<br>
  I guess I’ve just been<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  Somewhere else.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Just in my head.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I promise I wasn’t avoiding you.</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Mm, just avoiding the whole world then?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Yeah, yeah not far off.<br>
  You know me. It just turns into this whole<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  Thing<br>
  Like, I want to write back, I want to stay in touch, but I put it off</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Hey, no excuses, ok? You’re talking to me right now, and you’re coming to my wedding.<br>
  And you know I miss you, right?<br>
  Seriously June, I don’t give a fuck how long it takes you to write back, I’m just glad if you do.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I know but but I’m still sorry. I just think that I’ve put it off so long that it looks like I’m only replying out of some kind of forced obligation like the guilt’s finally built up enough to break through this dam I’ve put up and I have to respond just to make things less awkward but then I think those messages probably just got sent to me out of pity anyway, like they don’t actually want to talk but it’d be too obvious to just not send them but secretly they’re really hoping I don’t write back. And of course that’s not true I mean I fucking love you and you can be damn sure I’m going to be bawling my eyes out your entire wedding. </p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Hah, you sound like me when I was a teenager - it was like I was fucking Sherlock trying to solve the mystery of “does Corey really like me?” “Hmm, he sat next to me at lunch yesterday, but today he’s sitting with his other friends, although he did  wave at me, but was that a ‘come over’ wave or a ‘oh god I hope she stays over there but I need to be polite’ wave?”</p> 
  
  <p class="JUNE">Mhm, see this is why I stick to my gas-station fairytales.</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Ah come on, you know you can’t just give up, you need to get out there - even just to practice.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I’m trying, I’m trying, but like, do you have any idea how useless “get out there” is? </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Get out where? </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I’ve been everywhere, there are people everywhere, I don’t think the problem is being out there when I have no clue what to do when I get there. </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I’m not just going to accidentally stumble into success - we can’t just bumble around and finally find a solution, that’s not how this works. You know that saying - like give a million monkeys a million typewriters and someday you’ll get the works of Shakespeare?</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Apespeare</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">[snorts] Yeah, Apespeare<br>
  Because the idea is if you just randomly generate enough outputs then eventually one will be the desirable one. </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">It’s like there’s some purpose, some inherent direction to the work that just isn’t there. </p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Okay, sure</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">They tried it you know, they actually did it. Got a couple monkeys, some typewriters - not a million mind you - but they set it up and let them get to it. The best, and I’d guess only monkey authors. You know what they found?</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Wait - actual monkeys? They really just sat monkeys down at some typewriters? </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Yeah typewriters, computers, I dunno, it doesn’t matter.</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Where’d they even get the monkeys? <br>
  Did they just go to a zoo with a pickup truck full of typewriters and chuck them into the enclosure?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">[laughs] I don’t know - it doesn’t really matter. The point is they did - they did, god as my witness. Now whether that’s what you’d call “real science” is up for debate - I think it was more of a publicity thing.</p> 
  
  <p class="JUNE">I mean what could we even learn from that? </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Like, can you imagine if monkeys literally did just start churning out Shakespeare? </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Turns out we just think of something we want and monkeys write it - no idea how it works. We’ve been wasting time on machine learning and data centres, shoulda been using monkeys all along.</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">I’ve always thought Orangoutangs looked very wise.  </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">But they did, they sat these monkeys down at some keyboards and just let em go at it. Now I think you can spot the obvious flaw in that most monkeys aren’t especially familiar with computers or input devices in general, but that’s another issue.</p> 
  
  <p class="JUNE">They actually start typing though! </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">They saw these weird devices and started banging around and they ended up with five or six pages. You know what they wrote?</p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE">Gonna guess the answer isn’t plays or sonnets.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Well it turns out they really loved the letter S - just kept hitting it over and over, page after page.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="CLAIRE">So in this analogy you’re... what exactly?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">It’s not just me. <br>
  It’s everyone. <br>
  We’re all goddamn monkeys. </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Now sure, they haven’t got virtual reality or, like, penicillin, but other than that. </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">We fall into patterns and routines because we just don’t know what we’re doing. We’re not fuckin scientists - you know it’s not as if I’m going to follow the scientific method and try different hypotheses while on the hunt for friends or whatever. </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">For most of us when we have a problem we don’t know how to solve we’ll just keep hitting that S key over and over until we just throw the whole thing out because it’s not working.</p>

    <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>Mm, I don’t get it.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Well maybe you just need another drink.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>Hah, sure but that’s not it.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>I understand, you know. I understand what you’re getting at, but what’s the point?</mark> <br>
  <mark>It’s a cute story, but it just feels like</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>Resignation, I guess.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>You can’t really believe we’re all stuck just flailing through relationships like that.</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>Aren’t you just unbelievably tired?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>What?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>Don’t you get tired of this?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>You know, if you really wanted to be alone, that’d be fine.</mark><br>
  <mark>But I don’t buy it.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>You seem like you’re flying blind, trying to dodge dangers that just aren’t there.</mark><br>
  <mark>If you always go out assuming things are gonna crash and burn, isn’t some part of you going to try and make that come true?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>It’s not that I want it to happen.</mark><br>
  <mark>I just know it will.</mark><br>
  <mark>It always has.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>June.</mark><br>
  <mark>Do you assume the worst because you believe it?</mark><br>
  <mark>Or because it makes it easier to detach?</mark> </p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>If you’re always half in, half out of every social circle you’re always gonna feel like an outsider.</mark> </p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>Listen, I worry about you, we all worry about you. And it’s not because we think you’re incapable, you know, we’re not worried about you being like dead in a ditch somewhere.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>Fuck, June I know you’re tough, I wish I was more like that. We worry because we want good things for you, we hope for the best and it hurts to see you with less than you deserve. Do you really think that people just forget about you because you’re out of the picture for a little while? Do we seem that vapid?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Hey I didn’t mean</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>No, listen, ok.</mark><br>
  <mark>Listen.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>I wouldn’t be saying this if you weren’t sincerely important to me. You’re telling yourself this story, like you’re some kind of drifter, fading in and out of people’s lives, like the only evidence you exist is the extra plate from dinner, like you can just vanish and we’ll all be fine. You’re not a ghost, you don’t just get to come into people’s lives and then disappear and pretend like that’s the way it should be. You give yourself so little credit if you think like that, like, what, you think I don’t still remember the first day we met in college because you left your door open and you were playing a fucking harmonica and for some reason that was the strangest thing in the world to me, hearing harmonic drifting down the hall, and I knew I would never be satisfied if I didn’t go at least see whoever was doing that weird shit? And you’d always talk about the most bizarre nonsense you found sixteen levels deep in a Wikipedia rabbit hole and I never understood a word of it but I loved hearing about it because you just made it seem like the world was so much weirder and deeper than I realised. I want to hear about you, I want to know what your life is like because I know that it will always surprise me and it will never bore me.</mark> </p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>You’re smart, June, but you’re so fucking dumb sometimes.</mark> </p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>[sniffs]</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>You don’t get to decide how important you are to other people.</mark> <br>
  <mark>We’re not just gonna forget about you.</mark></p>
   
  <p class="CLAIRE"><mark>Don’t you know that?</mark></p>

  <p class="CLAIRE">No no I’m sorry too that was a lot.</p>

  No you’re right<br>

  But<br>
  Um<br>
  Thanks. Thanks for worrying.</p>

  Do we just hug and go watch a rom-com with a box of wine now or…?</p>
