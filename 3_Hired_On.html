<p class="EMIL">And that should be the last of them.<br></p>

<p class="JUNE">Good, not sure I’ll ever be able to hold a pen again.<br></p>

<p class="EMIL">Hah, well I have been meaning to ask HR to try and simplify the documents a little, it feels as though they enjoy watching people suffer through these contracts. <br></p>

<p class="EMIL">But on the bright side, now I can officially let you peek behind the curtain.<br></p>

<p class="EMIL">We are building something new here.
Really it’s half-built already. <br></p>

<p class="EMIL">A system that can comb through everything people say and do on our platform and find ways to connect them - find the common threads that could bring people out of isolation and knit them together - while shielding them from negativity.<br></p>

<p class="JUNE">So it’s more than just content moderation?<br></p>

<p class="EMIL">Yes. It began that way, until we started thinking bigger. <br></p>

<p class="EMIL">What do people say, you need to go through the hard times so you know when things are good?<br>
The lies we tell ourselves.<br></p>

<p class="EMIL">No one who is truly happy would say that.<br></p>

<p class="EMIL">It’s the same story as “money can’t buy you happiness.” The only people who say that are the rich who don’t want poor people to complain, and poor people trying to make themselves less miserable.<br></p>

<p class="EMIL">We have pharmaceutical researchers who claim that hormone and chemical imbalances make us unhappy, but what brings about those imbalances? We have religions that tell us it is the weight of our sins and distance from god that make us unhappy. We have a million bullshit peddlers each selling their own brand of commodified happiness. All supposed solutions, none successful.<br></p>

<p class="EMIL">What is the key thread?<br></p>

<p class="EMIL"><mark>Every single attempt at finding the key to happiness is based in humanity - our thinking, our behaviour.</mark> <br>
<mark>How can we possibly identify our failings when they are structurally inherent to our thoughts and reasoning?</mark> <br></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>You mean you’re developing an AI?</mark></p>

<br>
<br>
<p class="EMIL" style="padding-bottom:300px;"><mark>Precisely. But of course, we can’t turn it loose without guidance.</mark> <br>
<mark>We need liaisons, people who can bridge the gap and help it to learn.</mark></p>
