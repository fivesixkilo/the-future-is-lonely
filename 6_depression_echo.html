  <br>
  <mark>I don’t want to die, but I think just not existing could be nice</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>It’s hard to see everyone else moving through life, being happy and normal, when I’ll never feel like that</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>I hate going to sleep because it means I’ll have to wake up tomorrow</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>We all have such easy lives and we’re fucking them up and it makes it hurt even more</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>Anyone else just think they’re moving on auto pilot?</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>My life is cracking apart and no one cares</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>I’m too tired to feel depressed anymore</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>Does anyone else struggle to enjoy good days because they know bad days are coming?</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>I’ve been miserable for 30 years and I really can’t imagine 50 more</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>Why am I so surprised that no one talks to me when I don’t talk to them</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>No goals, no friends, no future</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>Sometimes I wish I could experience someone else’s life</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>can’t we just disappear</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>too much of a coward to even kill myself</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>I don’t deserve to feel depressed</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>my intrusive thoughts are starting to scare me</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>I don’t know how to cry anymore</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>Why do so many other people get to die while I have to keep going and going</mark><br></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Jesus</mark><br>
  <mark>This feels like watching people try to talk each other into jumping.</mark><br> </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>I don’t know.</mark><br>
  <mark>It’s not really for us, it’s probably good to have a place to get support and let these feelings out.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>I guess.</mark> <br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Not sure I’d call it a support group though.</mark> <br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Like, ok, empty nonsense like “Look on the bright side,” or “Oh it gets better, you just have to push through,” probably doesn’t help, but I guess I’m just not seeing the “support” here.</mark> <br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>The conversation can’t start AND END with “wow the world sucks and I want to die” ad infinitum.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>I don’t know, I think it’s pretty simple.</mark> <br>
  <mark>People get all wrapped up in their heads and then need a place to vent and unwind.</mark> <br>
  <mark>Of course they’re going to feel more comfortable doing that in a setting where they aren’t going to be judged or dismissed.</mark><br></p>

  How do you think people end up like this?<br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"> It has to start somewhere, right?<br></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I studied interactive artificial intelligence, not psychology.<br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Just humour me.<br></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I think you’re over analysing this. Sometimes people have dark thoughts or troubled lives and they need support.<br></p>
</div>
<div style="background-image:url(images/depression_echo/not_you.jpg); background-position: center top; background-repeat: no-repeat;">
  <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="MAC"><mark>It can’t be that simple.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Sure, for a lot of people it probably does function solely as a support group.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>But it seems like a lot of people don’t seek out groups like this, they stumble across them and for them, I think it starts because they find some kernel of truth.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Something relatable, just that initial seed.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Think of it like this.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>What would you do if I started calling you Kate?</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>[snorts] Probably tell you to fuck off.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Sure, sure because if I did that it’d be pretty clear that I’m messing with you.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>But what if other people started doing it too? You’re just walking down the street and “Hey Kate,” “Oh Kate! How are you?”</mark><br> </p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Eugh</mark><br>
  <mark>That’d be a little creepy.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"> <mark>Hah, I know. It’s like those stories where it turns out you were in a coma the whole time and people keep telling you to wake up.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>I always hate those stories, it’s the same as that whole simulation theory crap.</mark><br>
  <mark>Even if the whole world, every experience, every interaction we have is a dream, or a simulation, a hallucination, WHATEVER.</mark> <br>
  <br>  
  <mark>Then so what?</mark> <br>
  <br>
  <mark>Even if that’s true, we can’t prove it and we can’t disprove it.</mark> <br>
  <br>
  <mark>It doesn’t affect anything. It’s just mental masturbation for people who heard about it and want to sound deep. Plus if we only have “fake” experiences, are any of them really fake when we have no metric of “realness” to measure them against.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>[laughs] Sounds like you think about this a lot.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Oh don’t get me started. Every time some random CEO gets an interview and starts talking about how we’re probably all just simulated people or brains in jars put there by some super-smart future people or whatever I get a sprain from rolling my eyes.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Hah well I’m actually gonna agree with you there.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Oh wow no devil’s advocate crap today?</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>We’ll see, we’ll see.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>But my point is, we’re not computers than can just download “objective reality” and be done. So if everyone, and I mean literally everyone in your life started calling you a different name, that would probably freak you out. Just a little.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>The security guard that works weekends still calls me “Jane”.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>[laughs] Ok, well let me know if anyone else starts that too.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>But then imagine if you tried to correct them, you’d be like, “Hey, that’s not my name.” And instead of apologising or correcting themselves they get mad.</mark> <br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>They tell you:</mark> <br>
  <mark>No, that’s not your name. Your name is Kate and the only reason you think it’s not is because you’ve been brainwashed by society.</mark> <br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>And then someone else, who was just passing by, joins in and says, “Oh he’s right, we all know that your name’s Kate no matter what anyone else thinks.”</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Unless you’ve got the sturdiest fucking ego, you’re probably, at some point, going to ask yourself:</mark> <br>
  <mark>Wait, is my name Kate?</mark> <br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>If you have even the slightest bit of doubt then they can start to wedge themselves in.</mark> <br>
  <mark>And then I think they’ve got you.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Yeah but I would still know that’s not my name, I can remember my own name pretty easily.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>It’s an extreme example, but people are way more fallible than they like to think.</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>You know about the Mandela Effect right?</mark><br></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE"><mark>Ooooh my god I hate that shit so much.</mark><br>
    <br>
  <mark>Have you seen the Berenstain Bears one? I mean sure, that’s kind of a weird way to spell the name, but then you have all those people going, “wait, I don’t remember it like that, that’s impossible!”</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>It’s just remarkable</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>How dumb people are about that</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>Just accept that you have a shitty memory.</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>But nooo, instead they have to talk about how sure they are that it was BerenSTEIN Bears and not BerenSTAIN and that the only cause is overlapping realities or some nonsense.</mark><br></p>
  </div>
</div>
<div clas="dialogue">
  <p class="MAC">Exactly. So ok, if people can do those kinds of crazy mental gymnastics to justify their memory of a kid’s book series, why not for other things? <br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC">You join a support group online because you’re just not feeling so great.<br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC">And they start telling you, hey, look, it’s not your fault you feel this way. <br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC">It’s the world’s fault, that’s just how life is. You start thinking that these feelings aren’t temporary, or passing, but instead they are a natural result of the world.<br></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Think that’s kind of a stretch, like sure there are some fucked up people here, but it just seems like a place to vent.<br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Ok, yes there’s nothing wrong with venting, but that’s not what’s happening here.<br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Pull up that guy’s history<br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Four-thousand-six-hundred-and-twelve comments in this group<br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Does that look like venting? <br>
  Because to me, and tell me if I’m wrong, that looks like that guy practically lives here.<br></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Yeah sure you have the occasional person who’s in too deep but they’re not all like that.<br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC">No but there’s enough of them that anyone who’s not like that gets shut down pretty quick. It’s the same for at least half the “support” groups on here.<br></p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Ok but you can’t just dismiss the whole concept of support groups, they can be pretty life changing for people.<br></p>
</div>
<div style="background-image:url(images/depression_echo/listening.jpg); background-position: center top; background-repeat: no-repeat;">
  <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="MAC"><mark>I’m just saying, there’s a difference between a moderated support group where people are explicitly looking for help versus a hundred-thousand people signal-boosting each other and saying how much they hate themselves and each other.</mark> <br></p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>You see one person have a glimmer of hope, make a post about how they’re feeling pretty good and they think they might be able to get through this and then they’re instantly swarmed by a hundred other people telling them nothing can ever get better - nothing - and life is shit and the world is shit. So they learn to either get out or shut up and accept it.</mark><br> </p>
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>Plus there’s this whole superiority complex to it.</mark> <br>
    <br>
  <mark>I mean, yeah it’s depressing as all hell, but if you’re in the group then at least you know how the world works unlike all those sad people living their lives without that knowledge.</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>I think for a lot of them there’s a little rush in finding out how society really works.</mark> <br>
  <br>
  <mark>These are all the harsh truths people have been hiding from you your entire life, but now you’ve pulled off the blindfold and you see the world for what it really is.</mark> <br>
  <br>
  <mark>It’s hard to admit you’re wrong when you think you’re being smart and clever.</mark> <br>
  <br>
  <mark>Cause if you are wrong, well what then?</mark> <br>
  <br>
  <mark>Does that mean you’re not smart?</mark> <br>
  <br>
  <mark>You’re not clever?</mark> <br>
  <br>
  <mark>You really aren’t any different from anybody else, you’re just having trouble dealing with that?</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>Scary thoughts.</mark> <br>
  <br>
  <mark>I don’t blame people. I’m not saying that it’s their fault they feel this way - they just want to be seen, feel understood. It’s hard to get a good honest look at yourself.</mark> <br>
  <br>
  <mark>No matter how hard you try and contort you’re still just going to miss certain angles and see weird proportions that your brain can’t reconcile on its own.</mark><br>
  <br>
  <mark>We need other people to look back at us or we can’t really see ourselves. We’re fine-tuned to pick up signals from other people - but if they’re wrong or we’re just not getting them, what happens?</mark> <br>
  <br>
  <mark>What do you do if one mirror makes you look fat and another makes you look great?</mark> <br>
  <br>  
  <mark>How do you pick the one that’s real?</mark> <br>
  <br>
  <mark>Whichever one you pick becomes real, and you’ll start believing that and dismissing any other mirrors as being wrong.<</mark>br>
  <br>
  <mark>I don’t know, I think about this a lot, but maybe it’s all just crazy.</mark><br></p>

  <p class="JUNE"><mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>Yeah</mark><br>
  <mark>You gonna keep reading this stuff?</mark><br></p>
  
  
  <p class="MAC"><mark>No. No let’s wrap this up.</mark></p>
