  <p class="ROSE">*clink*</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">God I can’t wait until we’re feature complete, really sick of dealing with new glitches every day<br>
  You know, sometimes I think Emil’s team just adds new features to see how much it pisses off everybody else</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Yeah</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">And it’s like they call every update a “stability update”. I was talking to someone from engineering and he said we shouldn’t have any unexpected down time anymore. And I said sure, but that’s why we call it unexpected.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Mhm</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Right? Like as long as they keep breaking things and short circuiting the back end I don’t know how they expect things to go smooth. But hey if you don’t mind that sweet overtime I guess it works out pretty well when the website shits itself.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Whoa - this is delicious - you need to try this.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Nah<br>
  I’m good</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Alright, suit yourself.<br>

  Whoa it’s ok - it’s ok.<br>
  Here, take my napkin.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Shit I’m sorry, I know you just wanted to relax tonight and instead you’ve got me falling to pieces over a stupid glass and</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">And instead I’m asking a friend what’s got her so worked up.<br>
  Don’t tell me you just formed a deep emotional connection to that glass.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">[laughs]<br>
  I don’t really know<br>
  .<br>
  There was just this kid.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">A kid huh? Need me to beat him up?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">At work I mean<br>
  When I was going through the moderation queue.<br>
  Just fucked me up.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Oh, one of THOSE<br>
  Yeah sometimes there’s some real miserable stuff in there<br>
  [laughs] Today I had to ban someone for sharing pics of their own</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">No - no this one was different.<br>
  He was<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  I think he needed help.<br>
  He seemed so scared<br>
  Just scared and angry.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">I mean, isn’t that pretty much everybody these days?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I’m serious, Mac.<br>
  I think something bad happened to him.<br>
  And he didn’t know how to deal with it.<br>
  .<br>
  He’d been muted for weeks<br>
  And he didn’t even realise<br>
  He just sounded so scared and thought that everyone had abandoned him.<br>
  Like he was just screaming into an empty cave and just hearing his own echoes but distorted and twisted.<br>
  .<br>
  .</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Shit<br>
  June, I’m sorry. I know, it’s hard.<br>
  Sometimes you see people online that definitely need something to help them. Like, you just want to grab some of them and scream “Get off your computer!” but what can you do about it? It’s not like any of this is going away anytime soon - just gotta make the best of it. That’s our job - we have to go through the worst of it to make sure nobody else has to deal with it.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">.<br>
  .<br>
  You believe that?</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">What?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">That we’re <br>
  I don’t know<br>
  .<br>
  Making a difference?</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">I mean, yeah. Of course, somebody has to sweep up all the insults and hatred and bizarre depression memes. Seriously have you seen some of these? Someone will just post like a really artifacted picture of a noose with a laughing emoji and someone else just replies “mood” underneath it. Like what even is that? But it gets better every day, the more we train the algorithm the less work we have to do. laughs We’re kinda putting ourselves out of a job really.</p>

  <p class="MAC">Oh my god, June what you’re doing is helping people.<br>
  Think about how much shit would be out there if we weren’t cleaning it up every day<br>
  Think about how much worse it could be if we just let people share whatever disgusting, hateful crap they feel like subjecting everyone else to.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">But’s it’s only there because we’re here.<br>
  If Rose just didn’t exist no one would even have to do this job<br>
  And no one would have to see any of it<br>
  And no one would get hurt.<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  You didn’t see this kid.<br>
  It was his fucking grandmother who put in a help ticket.<br>
  She thought her account was broken!<br>
  She’d been trying to reach her grandson for weeks and he’d been trying to reach anyone and neither of them could do a thing because of us. He thought he was completely alone because of us.<br>
  Fuck, Mac. <br>
  We’re supposed to be making people happy, but it’s not real -  we’re just hiding all the misery under layers of code and we act like we’re</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">June</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">giving something back by showing them</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">JUNE</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">this fake bullshit world where nothing hurts and everything’s fine and</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">JUNE! June you can’t think like this. Yeah, I feel bad when I see someone in a bad place, but if they weren’t on Rose they’d just be feeling the same somewhere else. You are not anybody’s therapist, you can’t be so concerned with fixing them. You can’t put that on your shoulders.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">So what<br>
  We just don’t care?<br>
  .<br>
  and<br>
  .<br>
  PRETEND<br>
  like this is how things are supposed to be?<br>
  Just buy into Emil’s bullshit and act like we’re making a difference?</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">No, you can believe whatever you want, but you can’t blame yourself.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">.<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  That’s the problem - nobody does<br>
  No one blames themselves so when bad things happen it’s always someone else. It’s the system, or human nature, or some other excuse so that it can be anything but us.<br>
  Even if Emil’s right<br>
  Even if we manage to turn these heaps of code into something meaningful<br>
  We can’t just act like we’re not hurting people.<br>
  Like what kind of thinking is that? We get to say “oh sure we made it and designed it and maintain it, but it’s not our fault if it hurts someone.”</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">So what - you’re gonna take the blame every time someone gets hurt by something someone else says? People are people, they’re gonna hurt each other, we just have to do our best to soften the blow.<br>
  June, I understand. I really mean that, but you’re going to hurt yourself if you keep thinking like this.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">.<br>
  .<br>
  Whatever<br>
  Probably just drunk.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Well that goes for both of us.<br>
  But seriously, if this is bothering you so much you should really talk about it with someone.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I’m talking to you.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">[laughs] You know what I mean.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">[sighs] Yeah, yeah I do.</p>
