<p class="MINDWELL">Hello Ms. Owens, my name is Fabian, what would you like to talk about today?</p>

<p class="JUNE">I’m not sure. <br>
I’ve never tried anything like this before.<br>
Oh and you can just call me June.</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">Well June, people usually they find they get the most benefit from this by focusing on something in particular that’s bothering them. It can be a relationship, a fear, a dream, whatever you’d like.</p>

<p class="JUNE">Oh, cool. <br>
I guess things have been mostly fine. Work has been hard, but I think everybody feels like that.</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">What do you do for work?</p>

<p class="JUNE">It’s social media startup stuff, it’s only been a few months so I guess I’m still settling in. I don’t know, it’s sort of a different world for me.</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">Starting a new job can be stressful, do you enjoy it?</p>

<p class="JUNE">Sure I guess. <br>
It’s not bad - I’ve got good coworkers, nice building, plus - y’know - money’s nice to have.<br>
It’s exciting. <br>
Maybe. <br>
That’s always what I feel like I need to say. I’ll tell people about it and they always seem so surprised and intrigued.<br>
I wish I felt like that.</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">Do you think it’s boring?</p>

<p class="JUNE">No, no it’s not boring. It’s more that I guess I had this whole idea of the tech world in my head. You know, I’m sure you’ve seen news stories like, “New York Robotics Labratory Develops First Robot To Feel Love.” It sounds so magical, and we’re always told how smart and brilliant these people are, how they’re going to change the world. But it doesn’t feel like that to me anymore.</p>

<p class="JUNE">It’s</p>

<p class="JUNE">I don’t know</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">Disillusioning, perhaps?</p>

<p class="JUNE">Yeah, yeah that’s part of it.<br>
Also I just used to feel more secure that people working in tech knew what they were doing. Like, they must have a plan, or some kind of vision, there’s no way they’re just bashing things together and hoping it works.</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">Does it make you worry about the future?</p>

<p class="JUNE">No. Actually makes me really worry about today. It’s stressful feeling like anything can just come apart at the seams and no one will know how to fix it because they barely even know how it works. It feels like nobody ever asks “why”. We’re constantly trying out new things or designing new features, but no one is pausing to ask, “hang on, do we even need this?”</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">That can be a scary thought. It sounds like your job can be very stressful.</p>

<p class="JUNE">I guess it’s just people.<br>
Sorry, that sounds so vague.<br>
I mean the people that use the platform. I’ve always been kind of a people-watcher, but this is almost too much. It’s too close.</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">What do you mean by that?</p>

<p class="JUNE">I mean<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
It’s hard not to care about other people, at least for me. I need a bit of distance or I feel like I’m getting pulled in to their lives. So when I see so much about other people’s lives it almost feels like I know them and I just wish I could help them. Everyone just seems like they’re desperate for other people but no one is able to make that connection that gets them out of their own head. I guess people have always been lonely, but it’s different when you see so many of them.</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">You seem like a very caring person, does seeing other people like that make you feel lonely too?</p>

<p class="JUNE">No I don’t think so.<br>
I just understand where they are.<br>
And I wish I could do more for them. </p>

<p class="MINDWELL">What does being lonely feel like to you?</p>

<p class="JUNE">.<br>

      <p class="JUNE centered1" style="max-width:625px;"><mark style="font-size:400%;">Point Nemo?</mark><br><br>
        <mark>It’s this place in the pacific ocean, literally middle of nowhere.</mark><br><br>
        <mark>There’s nothing there, it’s not an island or anything, just a point on the map.</mark><br><br>
        <mark>You’re probably not going to find yourself there on purpose.</mark><br>
        <mark>The nearest land is 1400 miles away.</mark></p>

<div class="dialogue">
<p class="JUNE">Can you imagine that? It’s so far from land the closest person to you might just be in a space station when it flies overhead.<br>
So imagine - you go for a swim and the current catches you and no matter how hard you struggle you only end up further out to sea.<br>
And the waves keep pushing and pushing - but hey, maybe you find some driftwood, cling to it.<br>
Anything to keep your head above water, but the current’s still going.<br>
And then one day you wake up. </p>

<p class="JUNE">Nothing </p>

<p class="JUNE centered2">but sky </p>
<p class="JUNE centered3">and water</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="dialogue">
<p class="JUNE"><br>as far as you can see. </p>

<p class="JUNE">Of course, you don’t have a map. There could be land just over the horizon, or it could be a thousand miles of ocean. There’s no way to know.<br>
You could stay where you are, cling to something. You probably won’t drown - not yet. </p>

<p class="MINDWELL">But you could also swim.</p>

<p class="JUNE">Sure, sure but you’re already exhausted. At least if you stay put it’s familiar - kinda safe. You can survive - you’re not sure how long but you can survive. You tried swimming before, it just made you tired and you still ended up here, so why keep going? I think that’s what stops people. The don’t want to be lonely but they’re scared and hurt.</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">Do you feel scared and hurt?</p>

<p class="JUNE">Hah. No no I guess the third option is they’re just tired.</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">Do you feel so tired you want to give up?</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<p class="JUNE">No.<br>
No it’s not like that.<br>
I think I just want substance y’know. I don’t need a meaningless night of socialising with people I barely care about, I just need a connection. I feel like I don’t have the energy to waste anymore.</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">So you’re looking for a relationship?</p>

<p class="JUNE">Not like capital R Relationship, just connection.<br>
I want to know that someone else cares about the things I do.<br>
I want to know someone cares the way I do.</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">Have you found people like that?</p>

<p class="JUNE">pffff</p>

<p class="JUNE">When I was younger</p>

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 10%;">I’d always do this thing in winter.</p>

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 20%;">I’d wait for fresh snow - you know where I grew up we used to get a lot of it.</p> 

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 30%;">So I’d wait for snow and then I’d go out in the middle of the night maybe 2 or 3 am. </p>

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 20%;">Then I’d just walk. <br><br><br><br></p>

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 10%;">Usually until I couldn’t feel my toes - that’s how I knew it was time to go home. </p>

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 20%;">It’s cliche, but the world really is different then. </p>

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 10%;">It’s softer, it rounds out all the sharp corners and edges. </p>

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 30%;">I feel like I can handle that world better without scraping up my hands too badly.</p>

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 30%;">.
.
.</p>

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 30%;">Sorry</p>

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 20%;">That’s not the point. </p>

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 20%;">Like I said, I’d walk and walk and walk. </p>

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 30%;">Just leaving this long trail up and down and around every street in the city. </p>

<p class="JUNE" style="padding-left: 10%;">Kinda felt like writing my signature all over town. <br>
.<br>
.<br>

<p class="MINDWELL">You’re talking about this in the past tense, did you stop?</p>

<p class="JUNE">[sighs] Yeah, yeah I don’t really do that anymore.</p>

<p class="MINDWELL">Why?</p>
<p class="JUNE" style="text-align: center;"><br><br><br><br>.<br>
  .<br>
  .</p>
  <p class="JUNE" style="text-align: center;">Because I never once saw anyone else’s footprints.<br></p>
