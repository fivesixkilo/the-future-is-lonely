  <p class="JUNE">Uh hi, Emil. I got an email saying you wanted to see me?</p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">Yep, we need to discuss something.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">laughs That sounds kinda ominous.</p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">.<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  Yes.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Oh</p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">June, did you open a support ticket from a Mrs. Janet Nicholson a few weeks ago?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Yeah, yeah I remember she had an issue with messaging.</p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">Mhm, I know, we checked the logs. <br>
  That’s what I wanted to talk to you about.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Oh<br>
  Is this because I gave her that phone number? <br>
  I know that’s not exactly in the guidelines but I figured since she was family it’d be alright.</p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">That’s<br>
  .<br>
  more of a separate issue. Yes, that’s not exactly something we’re thrilled about, but frankly if that was the only issue we wouldn’t be talking in person.<br>
  No, what I wanted to show you is this.</p>

  <p class="EMIL">Yes.<br>
  I think you can see why this is problematic. We like offering your team a great deal of leeway in how you interact with users and resolve issues, we find that it leads to better more creative solutions, but this level of publicity is simply not acceptable. </p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">Now, don’t worry, this isn’t a termination meeting and we won’t be taking any disciplinary action.</p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">However</p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">I do want to remind you of the fact that you are a Rose representative. How you perform your work and interact with people reflects upon Rose as an entity and you do need to be cognisant of the effects of your actions. We’re not going to point fingers, but we will be sending out a memo detailing more… appropriate ways to resolve sensitive issues in the future. Do you have any questions?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Just a memo?</p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">Pardon?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">I mean.<br>
  Ok. <br>
  Fine. <br>
  I screwed up, but that article isn’t entirely wrong.<br>
  This is almost definitely going to happen again, it only worked out this time because his grandmother reached out. Like, I get the purpose of the quarantine system, but it feels almost thoughtless.</p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">June, I don’t mean to be rude, but I think that is more of a concern for the engineering and design teams.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Ok well<br>
  <i>not to be rude</i><br>
  but from my perspective it seems like this is their fault. <br>
  If I hadn’t responded to that ticket then that kid might be dead now and you’re - you’re worried about what? Bad PR?</p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">June</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Isn’t the whole reason we’re doing any of this supposed to be to make people happy? Make them believe there’s one goddamn port where they can weather the eternal storm that is the rest of their lives? Yeah I’ve seen the metrics - 98 percent of users say they’ve had five or fewer negative interactions on Rose! Wow, congratulations, what about those people like Michael that only have negative interactions? Or no interactions? Are they just not worth enough - is there some number of lives that we’re OK with ruining if it makes oblivious people happier?</p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">.<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  That’s an unfair question. </p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">Do you really believe you’re the only person I’ve spoken to about this incident? <br>
  Would it make you feel better knowing that I spent the entirety of the morning talking with the engineering team about how to prevent this in the future? <br>
  We’re working at the speed of imagination here, we are of course going to make mistakes. <br>
  But we will also learn from them and every step we take moves us further from where we are to where we can be. </p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">I don’t mean to sound callous. The idea that all progress is good regardless of the human cost is beyond repugnant. </p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">What is the point of progress if it leaves a wake a tragedy? Everyone that follows us will have to contend with the consequences of our actions, does that mean we ought to take no action? What are the consequences of inaction - can you be certain that doing nothing will somehow be morally superior to what you’re doing now? </p>
  
  <p class="EMIL">You could quit. We would miss the expertise and perspective you bring, but you could quit and go try to find something less harmful to involve yourself with, but do you really think such a thing exists? </p>

    <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>Do you know how many active users we have now?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>It’s alright, I know nobody reads all my update emails.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>Three hundred million, give or take. For most of them, we’re nothing more than a way to stay in touch. Most people use the platform just because it makes them feel less guilty about never having the time to see their cousins’ children, or to share frighteningly detailed information about obscure toys from thirty years ago.</mark> </p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>Compared to the industry titans we’re barely visible.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>But still, three hundred million.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>That means there are three hundred million ways we can utterly fail.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>Starting out, I told myself that we were nothing more than a small part of people’s lives. Something to make them feel that maybe there were some bright corners of the world. I told the same lie that everyone tells themselves: it’s not real. It’s all code and words on a webpage.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>But of course that isn’t true. Everything is as real as we make it to be, and for some we are more real than the hearts beating in their chests. And if we hurt someone, if we hurt someone like Michael</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>.</mark><br>
  <mark>But I can’t believe that doing nothing is preferable. Because to say that we should not try is to accept that things should stay as they are - to accept that this</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL" style="font-size: 250%;"><i><mark>this</mark></i></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>is the best things can be.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>If we don’t believe that we can do better, then what’s left? Do we just accept that our own nature puts us into an inevitable spiral of misery? I can’t believe that.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>I won’t.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>And even if that is just human nature. Even if we are creatures programmed to devolve into self-inflicted misery, how pathetic would it be to not even attempt change? I’m not blind, June. I know that we will not be the ones to get it right. But we’re making a start, and maybe at some point whoever comes next can either build on our success or avoid our failure. I won’t tell you to think about the people that we may be helping; it’s not some kind of equation that we can simply balance out.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>Count the good interactions and negative interactions, subtract, and see what comes out on top?</mark><br>
  <mark>Do you divide by grief, multiply by joy?</mark><br>
  <mark>What could the sum even tell us?</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>No, there’s no empirical answer to be found, and I can’t say for certain what will happen if we continue.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>But I know precisely what happens if we stop, if we allow fear and apathy to halt us.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>Our work ceases, whatever potential it had evaporates, and the rest of the world marches on, lock-step with the status quo.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>I don’t know if we can change the world.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="EMIL"><mark>But I couldn’t forgive myself if we don’t try.</mark></p>
