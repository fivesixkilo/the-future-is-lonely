  <p class="CREATOR">Happy Tueesssdayyy all my beautiful beautiful friends!</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I’m sure you’ve all noticed that I’ve been<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  a little erratic with uploading videos lately. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I want to try to explain that, but first I want to say that I will be taking a break. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I don’t know how long, but I think it’s really for the best for myself and my community. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">Now, I started this channel five years ago, and it has grown more than I could ever have imagined. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And that’s because of you - all of you. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">The support and love I’ve seen from this community is remarkable<br>
  [laughs] I promise I’ll try not to cry<br>
  it’s just incredible. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">It feels like I was only making videos in my bedroom yesterday and now I literally have a studio and film crew. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">That’s<br>
  .<br>
  That’s<br>
  .<br>
  There are no words for that. I can’t even believe it myself sometimes. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And in that time I feel like I’ve been able to open up more, put more of myself out there into the videos I make and that’s only strengthened the connections I have with you all. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">Which can be good, don’t get me wrong, but it’s also scary.<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  As some of you probably know, I have a history of depression. <br>
  I know this isn’t the first time I’ve talked about it on camera.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I’ve been coping with it in different ways since I was thirteen, but it was a lot harder when I was younger. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I didn’t know exactly what was happening to me - when I first started feeling what I now know was depression I didn’t have the experience or the maturity<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  I was too small. I didn’t even have the vocabulary to explain it.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I was miserable at school, but I thought everyone else was too, I just thought that was the default. <br>
  No friends, and I didn’t really have any hobbies.<br>
  Everything just seemed dull.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And I found that one the best things I could do to give myself a temporary hit of happiness was watching streamers. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I had a lot of trouble making friends when I was growing up, but hanging out in chat and watching someone joke and laugh their way through a game made me feel like I was a part of a group - I honestly started to sort of unknowingly think of them as my friends. Sometimes it almost felt like I was just on the couch next to them, laughing and joking right alongside.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And in some ways that was really what I needed then.<br>
  To feel like I wasn’t alone - that there were people who seemed to really love the same things as me.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">But I started leaning on those relationships a little too heavily. I’d avoid actually talking to my irl friends because I honestly didn’t have the energy, and it was so much easier to just sort of passively absorb these feelings of friendship online, so I didn’t even try.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">It kept on like this for uh, I guess a year or two and I just<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  I sort of left the real world slip away. I went to class, ate dinner with my family, but any spare moment I was with - what I considered to be - my real friends in my real life.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">.<br>
  .<br>
  .</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And then it all kind of fell apart. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">One of my favourite streamers - I’m not going to name drop, I really don’t want to see people start arguing in the comments so don’t even ask - was accused of assaulting some of his fans at conventions. </p>
  </div>
  <img src="images/content_creator/jc3_1.jpg" style="width:100%;">
  <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="CREATOR">And I<br>
  I don’t have an excuse<br>
  I jumped in to defend him. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">He was so nice and funny and dorky on stream that I knew - I knew - there was no way he could ever hurt anyone. He was perfect and sweet, and I really thought I knew him. They were just lying to start drama or to hurt his career, and I knew that it’d all blow over. </p>
  </div>
  <img src="images/content_creator/jc3_2.jpg" style="width:100%;">
  <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="CREATOR">And then there were more accusations. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And more. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And then a police investigation. </p>
  </div>
  <img src="images/content_creator/jc3_3.jpg" style="width:100%;">
  <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="CREATOR">And before too long he was in jail.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And I<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  I broke apart. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I actually felt physically ill for weeks.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">It felt like my best friend had suddenly just been ripped away from me. <br>
  All the growth I’d made over the years by dealing with loneliness through these online relationships suddenly felt unstable.</p>
  </div>
  <img src="images/content_creator/falling.png" style="overflow-x:hidden; width:1660px;">
  <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="CREATOR">I was scared - the ground had just been ripped out from under me.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I um</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">It was actually the first time I saw a therapist.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">God that sounds like such a first world problem.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">“This streamer I adored turned out to be kind of a shit and my life is falling to pieces!”</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">[laughs] Oh my god</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">It’s funny now</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">But it really did feel like my world had just<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  Evaporated</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And for a long time I still couldn’t believe it. I needed it to be fake.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">But it got better. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">It was hard at first, but it got better. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And eventually I started getting back into watching streams, but more as a spectator. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I had to remind myself that these people are personalities - they’re not being deceptive - but we’re never going to be able to see the full picture of who they are.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">.<br>
  .<br>
  .</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I think you can kind of see where I’m going with this.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I think this is an important thing to bring up, because I’ve started to see some of the same kind of defensiveness and almost worship that I felt now cropping up in my own community. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">You know, in some ways it feels like I’m on top of the world. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">It’s still hard to even comprehend my life today.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And I’ve definitely indulged in the fun that comes with being an F-list celebrity. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">Looking back, maybe that wasn’t the right thing to do.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I’ll be blunt: </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">You see professional me, fun me, goofy me.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">but you don’t know</p>
  </div>

  <img src="images/content_creator/memememe.png" style="width:100%;">
  <div class="dialogue">
  <p class="CREATOR">It’s like I’m on stage - it’s not fake, this is who I am, but it’s also an incomplete view.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">You never see any of the negatives because that’s not the point of this channel. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And lately I’ve started to feel uncomfortable. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I’ll say something stupid, or I’ll see drama pop up and my fans will rush to my defence saying, “She’d never do that!” talking about me like I’m a good friend of theirs. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">Which - I mean - of course that feels good, but it also terrifies me, because I’ve realised I have no control over it. It’s like there’s this subset of my fan base that is my own little hit squad, which is honestly just bizarre to even consider.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I mean, that is incredible, it’s overwhelming. Thinking that people I’ve never met have found my content so relatable and meaningful that they actually count me as a friend. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">But it’s unhealthy. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">Of course there is a kind of relationship between us, of course, but it’s not like other relationships. I used to engage more with you all in the comments or on stream, but lately it makes me feel uncomfortable, it makes me feel like I’m tricking you into believing I’m your friend when really I’m just a personality you know through your screen. </p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And it’s hard for me. I want to be there for you. I’ve gotten dozens of emails from people telling me that my videos got them through a rough time in their lives and</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">And</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">Oh god</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">That makes my day and it breaks my heart.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">Because I worry about you all. I care about you - I may not know you personally but I really do care. But I also need to accept that I can’t be responsible for you all, and you can’t solely rely on me.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">It’s dangerous. I’m not perfect, I can hurt people and I have hurt people, not purposefully but it still happens. But acting like I or anyone else you see online is perfect is unhealthy. You’re seeing the most edited, most purposeful depictions we have of ourselves, and if you start believing that we are just the personas we project you’re going to set yourself up for disappointment.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I know what that feels like.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I’ve gone back and forth on this dozens of times in my own head.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I want to be who you all believe I can be</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">But I don’t want to set you all up to fall like I did</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">Because it hurts, and honestly it still hurts sometimes.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">So I need you all to know that I love you.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">If you’re struggling, if you’re alone and feel like there’s nothing in the world for you, then I need you to know that I understand.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">But you don’t need me, you can be strong, and you can meet friends. I’ve seen footage of fan meet-ups - I mean holy shit, I saw the pictures of two people who got married because they met in my chat.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">They thanked me. Can you believe that? They thanked me.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I had to write them an email<br>
  I said “no, look you guys are an inspiration to me. Like, how do you go from sharing crappy emojis in chat to meeting and starting a family? That’s unbelievable!” I mean, I know I’m pretty cool, but there’s no way that’s all because of me.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I didn’t have a thing to do with them getting together - that was all them. If they hadn’t met in my chat it would have been someone else’s.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">So I don’t want you to rely on me.</p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR">I will be back to steaming and making videos, I don’t know when, but I’ll be back.</p>

  <p class="CREATOR"><mark>But it will be different. I’m going to work with my moderators to take over most of the community interaction that I’ve done in the past. I don’t want to leave you guys in a lurch where suddenly I’m not saying anything publicly, but I definitely will be stepping back from directly interacting. I’m thinking more of a kind of curated sort of Q&A session. I don’t know exactly, let me know in the comments if you’ve got any good ideas for that.</mark></p>
  
  <p class="CREATOR"><mark>So again, you all are fantastic, and I’ll be back.</mark> </p>

  <p class="MAC">I honestly miss the days when streamers just played video games for an unhealthy amount of time.<br>
  Now it’s all<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  .<br>
  Complicated.<br>
  It’s like everyone is competing to show their own little slice of life.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Well you give people a little taste of a life that seems far more interesting than theirs and they’re gonna want more than just a slice, they’re gonna expect the whole cake. I didn’t realise it had all gotten so serious though.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">It has to be exhilarating, seeing what looks to be such a fascinating perspective of someone else’s life, so complete that you can almost slip into it yourself. You know it’s not yours, but if you defocus a bit then it’s close enough.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Then the stream ends, the show stops, and you’re left to fill the time.</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Do you think she’s right?</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">You mean about being too close to her fans?</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">Mhm</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">Yeah, yeah I can see her point. It’s gotta be hard, you find someone who, at least outwardly, appears to be a pretty perfect match for you friendship-wise. Finding friends is hard, so even just a facsimile of it is probably enough for people to hold on to. Only problem is it’s pretty much a one way street. Like, you’re having to provide both sides of the friendship while modelling some kind of mental version of them that fits how you see them. They’re not gonna live up to that. Just sounds like a recipe for tragedy when you realise someone that means the world to you probably hasn’t even seen a single one of your comments, and is really nothing like who you’ve convinced yourself they are. At least she’s being honest about it, not stringing them along.</p>
  
  <p class="JUNE">So whadya think, write it up?</p>
  
  <p class="MAC">[laughs] Yeah, yeah let’s try to explain this one to Rose. </p>
