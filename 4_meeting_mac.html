<p class="EMIL">And this is your office, you’ll be sharing with our head liaison.</p>
<p class="AMBIENT">
*knock knock*
</p>
<p class="EMIL">Mac, do you have a free moment? This is June, she’s joining your department.<br></p>

<p class="MAC">Oh, fantastic! Didn’t know you were starting so soon. <br></p>

<p class="EMIL">Mac has actually been with us from the very beginning, so he knows the system inside and out.<br></p>

<p class="MAC">Only because I have to keep cleaning up the messes from your team.<br></p>

<p class="EMIL">[laughs] Admit it, you would be terribly bored if there wasn’t the occasional hiccup.<br></p>

<p class="MAC">Yeah, yeah I suppose. </br>
June, right? How’s the tour been so far?<br></p>

<p class="JUNE">It’s been<br>
.<br>
A lot actually. I didn’t realise just how extensive the campus was.<br></p>

<p class="MAC">A lot of people notice that when they visit, seems a lot bigger on the inside. <br>
I guess Emil’s taken you to the canteen already?<br></p>

<p class="EMIL">You know me too well.<br></p>

<p class="JUNE">Yeah that was actually where we did my “not-a-job-interview” interview. Nice coffee.<br></p>

<p class="MAC">Eh, forget about that crap - I’ve been telling them to get better coffee for months now.<br></p>

<p class="EMIL">Alright, well I am going to leave you two now. June it was a pleasure to see you again and I hope you’ll let me know how you’re getting on once you’ve settled in. Mac should be able to show you everything else you need to know.<br></p>
<p class="AMBIENT">

</p>
<p class="MAC"><mark>Kind of overbearing, isn’t he?</mark><br></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>[laughs] It felt like I was back home for the holidays and my grandma was fussing over me.</mark><br>
<mark>“Do you need anything?”</mark><br>
<mark>“Are you comfortable?”</mark><br></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>But it was still fascinating to get his perspective, he really does believe in this.</mark><br></p>

<p class="MAC"><mark>Oh it’s all pie in the sky junk with him.</mark> <br>
<mark>You listen to Emil too long and you’ll think we’re curing cancer here.</mark><br></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>I mean, it does seem interesting from what he said though.</mark> <br>
<mark>The sheer amount of data you have available to leverage in a positive way is staggering.</mark><br></p>

<p class="MAC"><mark>Well we try, we try.</mark> <br>
<mark>I’m guessing he didn’t really tell you much about the nuts and bolts of what we’re doing though.</mark><br></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Uh, no not really.</mark> <br>
<mark>He just seemed really excited about the concept.</mark><br></p>

<p class="MAC"><mark>Yeah, figures. Ok, well on a really basic level</mark><br>
<mark>Wait you signed all the NDAs, right?</mark> <br></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Yeah</mark><br></p>

<p class="MAC"><mark>Ok - so on a basic level, we don’t really have a lot to do.</mark> <br>

<mark>For the most part, the algorithm that Emil’s team maintains does a pretty good job of managing content and helping users with common issues.</mark><br></p>

<p class="MAC"><mark>Where you and I come in is when it gets stumped.</mark><br>
<mark>It’ll know something isn’t right with whatever it’s checking, but it’s not confident enough to make a decision, so it kicks it to us.</mark> <br></p>

<p class="MAC"><mark>We tell it what to do</mark><br>
<mark>It</mark> <br>
<mark>And we slowly put ourselves out of a job.</mark><br></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>How does that work? Is it just learning pattern recognition?</mark><br></p>

<p class="MAC"><mark>Ugh, you’d have to ask Emil for the technical details.</mark> <br>
<mark>As far as I know, it’s sort of two integrated systems.</mark> <br></p>

<p class="MAC"><mark>One was trained on social media data to learn about the obvious positive / negative, happy / sad qualities of language.</mark> <br></p>

<p class="MAC"><mark>That one’s good at yes or no stuff - very binary questions based off language and word choice.</mark> <br></p>

<p class="MAC"><mark>The other part is a bit more</mark><br>
<mark>.</mark><br>
<mark>Thoughtful.</mark> <br></p>

<p class="MAC"><mark>It’s not AI</mark><br>
<mark>At least I wouldn’t call it that</mark><br>
<mark>But if the first one can answer “what” questions, this one asks “why”.</mark> <br></p>

<p class="MAC"><mark>So when it finds something it can’t quite parse, it comes to us and we can give it an explanation.</mark><br></p>

<p class="JUNE"><mark>Oh that’s</mark><br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
That’s much further along than I would have guessed.<br></p>

<p class="MAC">[laughs] Lotta responsibility huh?<br>
Always said I didn’t want a kid and now I’m helping to raise this weird cyber-baby to police a website.<br></p>

<p class="JUNE">Hah, it’s just a lot more interesting than I expected.<br>
I mean, despite what Emil said it still sounded like this was all still in the conceptual development phase.<br>
I didn’t expect it to already be deployed.<br>
Does it really work like he says?<br></p>

<p class="MAC">It’s early days.<br>
Really it’s been early days for the past two years.<br>
But I can’t deny that it practically runs the entire platform.<br>
Sometimes you can even get a feel for how it’s learning.<br>
And yes, you’d be surprised at how different our user interactions are compared to other platforms.<br></p>

<p class="JUNE">Hm.<br>
Is that really significantly different from just having a large moderator team?<br></p>

<p class="MAC">[laughs] Emil told me you were a pessimist, I think that’s why he hired you.<br></p>

<p class="MAC">It is different though. It understands us, but doesn’t think exactly like us. You know, when we notice someone drifting away we might make an attempt at reaching out, but how much energy do you really have for other peoples’ problems?<br></p>

<p class="MAC">Rose<br>
Sorry, the algorithm<br>
Acts before you or I could even notice.<br></p>

<p class="JUNE">Does it make the right choice?<br></p>

<p class="MAC">Well<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
That‘s why you and I are here.<br></p>
